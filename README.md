Brain Computer Interface
The possibility of establishing a direct communication and control channel between the human brain and computers or robots has been a topic of scientific speculation and even science fiction for many years. Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) allow their users to communicate or control external devices using brain signals rather than the brain's normal output pathways of peripheral nerves and muscles.
